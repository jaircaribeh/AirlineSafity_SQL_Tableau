Analyzing the data, I understood that I could do a study to try to understand which places had the highest percentage of fatal accidents, as well as incidents during the 30 years, to compare the incidents between the year 1985 to 1999 and 2000 to 2014
Show the total of Fatal Accidents, Fatality and Incidents.

The data was loaded into the SQLServer, I analyzed it to see if it was missing values ​​in the table, if it had spelling errors, etc. I created another table, inside that table I created another column giving the name of Regions related to the aircraft and I loaded all the data in it.

After that I connected Tableau to SQLServer and made the dashbord.
